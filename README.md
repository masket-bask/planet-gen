# planet-gen

[ node.js ]

i have no idea what i want to do with this but it generates simple images of planets

**the code is very spaghetti, i don't necessarily feel like fixing it**



## getting started

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/masket-bask/planet-gen
$ cd planet-gen
$ npm install
$ npm start
```



## a couple images that it produced
