# planet-gen

[ node.js ]

This was the code I generated long back to produce the generative planets, later I have made certain changes to the code in order to create the version 2 of this this generative art work just for the purpose of zilliqa blockchain network.

This recent version of the NFT is capable of producing much more clear and detailed images of crypto-planets.
